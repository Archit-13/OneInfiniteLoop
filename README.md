### **CMPUT 301 Project**

Booksies is an android application with the following characteristics:

  1) The design should allow developers to extend or migrate project

  2) The mobile application should allow owners to record and loan books to borrowers and borrowers to request and borrow books. 
     A user can both be an owner of one's one books while borrowing someon else's books.
     Once borrower's request is accepted, the book can be borrowed and a meeting location can then be decided on. 
     Owner can denote when such book should be returned and can again make it available to other borrowers.
  
  3)The app can be downloaded from the CI Android Release artifact for the apk by using a valid Github Account.
  
  4)This app is made using the 5.0 inch, 1080x1920, 420 dpi (Pixel2) configuration. Layouts may be different or inconsistent will other dimensions.
  (We have tried to implement relative layout wherever possible)
